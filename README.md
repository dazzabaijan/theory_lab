# Theory Lab: The Wetting Transition - Exploring Liquids at an Interface with Matlab

A statistical mechanical treatment is applied to the investigation of the density profiles of a fluid by means of a method called classical *density functional theory* (DFT).
In particular, the density profiles of fluids are under the influence of a Lennard-Jones
